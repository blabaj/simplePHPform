# simplePHPform

Just for initials this is the simple PHP form. Just for beginners it helps how to manage your code in a way that each person 
can understand. 

Run index.php file in local server i.e XAMPP, if there is any problem in first attempt, try second attempt.

There is no need to create table or database manually bcz it automatically create database of 'userinfo' and a table 'info' 
with required properties.

Enjoy using it.

Have a blessed day ...
